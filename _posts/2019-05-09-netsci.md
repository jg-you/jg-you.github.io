I will give a few presentations at NetSci 2019 and at the surrounding events.
First, I've been asked to kickoff the [SYNS 2019 Pre-Conference Event](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/syns) "*I'd like to learn from...*" with an overview of [Universality of the SBM](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.98.032309). This will be a fun laid-back event on the Sunday that precedes the satellites.
I'll then give a flash talk at [SINM 2019](http://danlarremore.com/sinm2019/schedule.html), in which I'll present exciting new work on epidemiology that I've been doing with [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/) and [Samuel Scarpino](http://scarpino.github.io/).
I'll close out the week with a talk on Friday at the main event, where I'll discuss of "*Compression of treelike complex networks using layered configuration models*" (joint work with [Antoine Allard](http://antoineallard.github.io/) and Laurent Hébert-Dufresne).
Mark Newman will also touch on some work we've doing together, in his SINM contributed talk.

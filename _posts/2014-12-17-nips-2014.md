Last week, [E. Laurence](http://www.dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca/members/) and I attended the [NIPS 2014 workshop session](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2014/Schedule?type=Workshop) in Montreal, Qu√©bec, Canada.

[Surya Ganguli](http://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/pubs.html) gave an excellent talk on deep learning ideas derived from statistical physics.
As a "community detection" guy, I found the [Networks Science Workshop](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2014/Schedule?showEvent=4273) especially interesting.
Half of the invited speakers presented recent results in that area of network science.
There was, two particularly noteworthy talks.

[Liza Levina](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~elevina/) introduced a [overlapping spectral detection algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3432), and [Cristopher Moore](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~moore/) showed us how the [ideas](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5550) of [statistical mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7789) can be used to better understand [community detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5787).

The accepted papers can be found on the [workshop page](https://410f84824e101297359cc81c78f45c7c079eb26c.googledrive.com/host/0Bz6WHrWac3FrWnA5MjZqb3lWa2c/).

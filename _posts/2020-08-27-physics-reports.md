Our review of higher-order approaches to network science is finally out as Volume **874** of [Physics Reports](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0370157320302489) (freely accessible to all).
It is the fruit of an extensive (800+ references) collaborative effort led by [Federico Battiston](http://www.personal.ceu.edu/staff/Federico_Battiston/) and [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io/).
If you want the TL;DR, Iacopo Iacopini wrote an excellent summary of the review that can be found [here](https://iaciac.github.io/post/beyond/)
Needless to say that the field is teeming with exciting ideas and that it was a treat to survey them and their precursors, going decades back.

PS: We can thank the [Complex Systems Summer School at SFI](http://www.jgyoung.ca/conferences/news/2015/04/10/netsci2015.html) for this project, since three of us met during the 2015 editions.

I'll be at NetSci 2018 (Paris) to present our recent preprint "*[Network archaeology: phase transition in the recoverability of network history](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09191)*".
The [program](https://www.netsci2018.com/conference-program) is already out: I'm part of the **Theory-I** parallel session, on day 1 of the main event.

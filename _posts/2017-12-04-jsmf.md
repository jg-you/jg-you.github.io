While it was been announced some times ago at [Universit√© Laval](https://www.lefil.ulaval.ca/lunivers-complexe-de-jean-gabriel-young/), I haven't posted this news here yet. So here goes: I'm beyond _thrilled_ to announce that I have been selected by the [James S. McDonnell Foundation](https://www.jsmf.org/programs/cs/) for their Postdoctoral Fellowship Awards in "_Understanding Dynamic and Multi-scale Systems_".

I have not yet decided where I will be pursuing my postdoctoral studies, but one thing is certain: the next few years are going to be both intellectually stimulating and fun.

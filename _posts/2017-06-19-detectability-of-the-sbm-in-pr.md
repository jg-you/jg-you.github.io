title: Detectability of the SBM in Phys. Rev. E,

So, two short news.
First, "_Finite size analysis of the detectability limit of the stochastic block model_" is now published in [Phys. Rev. E](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.062304); I'll upload an updated version to the arXiv soon (after [NetSci 2017](http://netsci2017.net/)).
It is a long paper, so it was a long process.
I'm glad to see it through! 
Our coolest result are, I believe, **1.** the symmetry group of the SBM and **2.** our approximation solution of the hypersurface equations.
The first tells us what transformations of the parameters maintain the difficulty of the detectability/recovery problem, while the second determines the surface of constant detectability in the parameter space.

Second news: I'll be giving an extra talk at NetSci, during the satellite sessions [**tomorrow**](http://complexdata.businesscatalyst.com/program.html) (I've already announced this earlier [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jgyou/status/874687304065011712)). I'll present the [Simplicial Configuration Model((https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10298)) and some recent related work done with [Alice Patania](http://apatania.altervista.org/), Giovanni Petri and Franseco Vaccarino. 
The slides should be up on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/jgyou/) by the end of the talk!

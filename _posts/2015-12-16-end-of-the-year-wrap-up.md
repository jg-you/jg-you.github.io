Between conferences, a month long summer school, a doctoral exam and multiple papers, suffice to say that 2015 has been a crazy year.
As a result, I ended up updating this website much less than expected.
The Christmas break should allow me to remedy the situation.
In the meantime, _three_ papers on which I collaborated appeared in [PLoS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/) and [Physical Review E](https://journals.aps.org/pre/).
Head over to my [publication page for more details](/publications.html).
Until then, happy new year!

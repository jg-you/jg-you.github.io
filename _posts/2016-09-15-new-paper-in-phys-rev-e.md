My latest paper with [L. Hébert-Dufresne](https://sites.google.com/site/laurenthebertdufresne/), [A. Allard](http://antoineallard.info) and [L.J. Dubé](http://dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca/) is now out in Physicial Review E.

In the paper, titled  ["Growing networks of overlapping communities with internal structure"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.94.022317), we come up with a natural and dynamical explanation of the Dunbar number, i.e., an upper bound on the number of connection that individuals can sustain in a social network.
We show how this number is related to the heterogeneity of the degree distribution of nodes _within_ communities and investigates the consequences of this explanation for networks which have a growing and overlapping community structures.

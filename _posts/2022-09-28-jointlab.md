[Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/) (LHD) and I recently joined forces and created the Joint Lab --- a collaborative exploration across sciences with models and data.
It combines the strength of the Laboratory for Structure and Dynamics, led by LHD, and the Complex Data Laboratory, led by myself.
We are a big group of researchers with a like-minded approach to complex systems research and data science.
And we now have [a shinny new website](https://joint-lab.github.io/), created in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) by [Edward Laurence](https://edwardlaurence.me/)!
Check it out for a list of our latest [publications and artifacts](https://joint-lab.github.io/publications), an overview of [our team](https://joint-lab.github.io/people), and [job opportunities](https://joint-lab.github.io/lab).

Our paper "[*Which contributions count? Analysis of attribution in open source*](https://2021.msrconf.org/details/msr-2021-technical-papers/24/Which-contributions-count-Analysis-of-attribution-in-open-source)" has won the [FOSS award](https://2021.msrconf.org/track/msr-2021-foss-award?) at the 2021 Mining Software Repositories (MSR) conference. The award recognizes papers that show outstanding contributions to the FOSS community. The paper examines the various ways in which people are given credit for their work on Open Source Software, and identifies areas where existing methods of attribution could be improved.   This is a huge honor, as it is my first time attending the MSR conference.  Many thanks to the awesome collaborator who worked on the project. PS: We also wrote a [short op-ed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-020-00011-w) in Nature Computational Sciences a few months back, highlighting some of those problems. Our MSR paper is a continuation of this work.

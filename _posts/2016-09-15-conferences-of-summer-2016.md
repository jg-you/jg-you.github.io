Summer has officially ended: on-campus activity levels are back to normal and classes are picking up.
This means that, as usual, I can wrap-up summer conferences and announce my talks after the fact... I really ought to start announcing those _prior_ to the conferences...

First thing first, my collaborators and I presented many new results at [Netsci 2016](http://netsci2016.net/) (Seoul, South Korea),
I personally gave two talks about my upcoming paper on the finite size analysis of the detectability limit of the stochastic block model. The first presentation was part of the [Statistical Inference for Networks Models satellite (SINM))](http://danlarremore.com/sinm2016/), and the second presentation took place during the lightning talk plenary session---quite the experience!
My long-time collaborator [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](https://sites.google.com/site/laurenthebertdufresne/) also gave a lightning talk, where he introduced our new voter model on the adaptive stochastic block model. The [associated paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04632) is currently in submission, and available on the arXiv.
Two new members of Dynamica---the [Université Laval research group on Complex networks](http://dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca)---also presented at NetSci: Charles Murphy gave a talk on growing random geometric networks, and Guillaume St-Onges presented a poster on coupled growth and spreading dynamics.
Finally, [Alice Patania](http://apatania.altervista.org) presented our work on growing simplicial complexes, developed during my stay at the [ISI Foundation](http://www.isi.it/).
Slides, papers, and more can all be found on my [publications page](/publications.html).

I also gave a tutorial on spectral graph clustering at the "CRM 2016 Summer School on Spectral Theory and Applications", in Québec, Canada.
This summer school is targeted towards graduate student beginning their PhD in mathematics, physics and applied mathematics.
I produced _a lot of material_ for the tutorial;
You can head over to [this page](/crm2016/index.html">) to download the slides, lectures notes and python notebooks used during the tutorial.

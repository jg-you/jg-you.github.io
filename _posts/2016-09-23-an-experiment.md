I'm now managing my website's content with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
The rewrite took some time, but it is definitely worth it.
Jekyll is much more powerful, flexible and efficient than my previous static website generator.
Not that it was exactly hard to beat---the previous version of my website was handled by a [buggy, incomplete, and partial Jekyll rewrite of mine](https://github.com/jg-you/science-static).
Back then, my goal, was to learn python, and it definitely helped. But why reinvent the wheel when you know how to drive? Out with `static-science`, Ã¬n with `jekyll`.
Oh, and I also took this opportunity to reskin the site.

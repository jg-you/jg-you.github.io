I'm now managing my website's content with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
The rewrite took some time, but this new static website generator feels much more powerful and efficient.
Not that it was hard to beat---the previous version of my website was more or less handled by a [buggy, incomplete, and partial Jekyll rewrite of mine](https://github.com/jg-you/science-static).
Back then, my goal, was to learn python, and it definitely helped.
I also took this opportunity to reskin the site.

My submitted talk "*Statistical mechanics of mesoscopic structure extraction*" has been accepted at [NetSci 
2017](http://netsci2017.net/). I will present a unifying point of view of 
community 
detection and mesoscopic structure in general, using the language of statistical mechanics.
This is joint work with members of [my research group](http://www.dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca), who will also present quite a few 
talk of their own, see [this list of abstracts](http://www.dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca/index.php?id=conferences).

See you there!

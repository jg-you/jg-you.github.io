I will be co-chairing the first [Open NetSci Hackathon](https://opennetsci.github.io/) with [Alice Patania](https://alpatania.github.io).
Our goal is to hold a fun, laid back warm-up event before the flagship [NetSci conference](http://netsci2019.com/).
We're already two months out and hope to see you all there. 
The line-up of experts is beyond amazing.

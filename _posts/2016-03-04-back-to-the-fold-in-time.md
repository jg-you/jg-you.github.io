This year started pret-ty intensely, with a working group at the [Santa Fe Institute](http://www.santafe.edu) and a month-long residency at the [ISI Foundation](http://www.isi.it/).
The dust is still settling, but a couple of interesting projects should come out of it, to be presented at [NetSci 2016](http://netsci2016.net) and / or other conferences this upcoming summer.

I'm also happy to announce that a paper with a _long_ history has finally been published in Physical Review E (and that it's the Editor's suggestion of the week)!
The theory was mostly developed during [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](https://sites.google.com/site/laurenthebertdufresne/home)'s time as a PhD student at Université Laval (circa 2014), but has since evolved into a sounder, more comprehensive framework.
[In the paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0112), we show how preferential attachment and delayed temporal scaling in the growth of a resource lead to a scale independent distribution of resources.
It turns out that the delayed temporal scaling is strict enough to predict both the past and the present of a scale-free system, _from a single snapshot of its present state_.
It will be interesting to see how this relatively simple mechanism can be coupled with other preferential attachment based model.

Big news. I will become an assistant professor at the University of Vermont starting this fall! My main appointment will be with the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/mathstat) with a joint appointment at the [Larner College of Medicine](https://med.uvm.edu/), where I will join the modeling team of the [Translational Global Infectious Diseases Research Center (TGIR)](https://www.med.uvm.edu/tgircobre/home).  I will of course stay on the faculty of the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/) to work with all the fine folks over there, as well as on the faculty of the [Computer Science department](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs) (secondary appointment). Quite a mouthful!


I will be looking to hire soon, so stay tuned.

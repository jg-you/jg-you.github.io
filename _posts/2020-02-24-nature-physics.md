[Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufrense](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/), [Samuel Scarpino](http://scarpino.github.io/), and I just published [a letter](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0791-2) where we argue that interacting contagions look like complex contagions.
[Sune Lehmann wrote a great perspective piece](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0817-9.epdf?shared_access_token=WPV1ymOU9VdS86G9J1CqlNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OTCQSm_WskCqpgL934ht-e0XiaJBsrRv9R_E6hNVPI1_ndb9rDvSmgpBLSzDSBztlSsmdDW-jfJYWvBwYm_g2IgksrPqEx4xSp2U6j95B12g%3D%3D&fbclid=IwAR0PTgJxh4Y24vGyvZniIeDNrqCuQuxmVjYKRv4iH9MxiukPWq7wwp34Vb4) that explains our work and its implication really well.
In a nutshell, we show that one can't use macroscopic patterns to prove that a contagion is "complex" ---  simpler mechanistic explanations, like interacting *simple* contagions, give rise to the same patterns.
The upshot is that models of complex contagions are much more tractable than the corresponding models of interacting contagions.
Hence, our mapping provides a tractable method to fit  models of interacting contagion,  and a characterization of their complexity.
I have made all the code, slides and material available online; see [the following link](http://www.jgyoung.ca/publications.html#peer-reviewed-journals)!

In January 2016, [Laurent Hébert-Dufrense](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/), [Antoine Allard](http://antoineallard.github.io/), [Pierre-André Noël](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FxU9cG0AAAAJ), [Eric Libby](http://ericlibby.github.io/) and I got together for a [SFI](https://www.santafe.edu/) working group, to investigate competitor dynamics on networks.
Our starting point was the connection between [voter models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_model) and [the Moran process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran_process), and, more generally, questions about the political arena and biology.
Our answers are now available in a *Scientific Reports* paper titled "[_Strategic tradeoffs in competitor dynamics on adaptive networks_](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-07621-x)".

In the paper, we introduce a voter model on the adaptive SBM (the structure of the network changes depending on who's claiming what resources); it turns out that the model can be mapped to a well-known evolutionary game theory problem.
**The upshot?** This gives us a game-theoretical perspective on network structure.
In turn, this allows to conclude that, for example, sustaining echo chambers instead of open discourse is  not a robust and viable strategy.

Summer 2015 will be action packed.

[L. Hébert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/) and I will be [A. Allard](http://antoineallard.info/)'s new base camp in Barcelona, during the week of May 24th.
Our [joint work](/publications.html) has always been fruitful and fun, and this visit should lead to interesting new projects.

The following week, I will be attending the 2015 edition of [NetSci](http://netsci2015.net/), in Zaragoza, Spain, alongside with many current and past colleagues.
This year, we are presenting _two_ poster contributions. 

The [first contribution](/files/netsci2015_EDAbstract.pdf) summarizes the results of a collaboration with [E. Laurence](http://edwardlaurence.me), [Sergey Melnik](https://sites.google.com/site/svmelnik/) that started back in November 2014 when he visited our research group in Québec.
In a nutshell, we adapted [a set of iterative equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4369) that  _exactly_ solves bond percolation on arbitrary networks to the more general [cascade dynamics](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.77.046117) of James Gleeson and colleagues.
Bond percolation, node percolation and the [Watts threshold model](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/9/5766.full) are all special cases of this approach (!).

The [second contribution](/files/netsci2015_JGYAbstract.pdf) introduces a large class realistic of benchmark graphs for community detection. 
These graphs are based on the [Structural Preferential Attachment](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.158702) principle, and exhibit extremely varied structural features depending on the choice of parameters.
Stay tuned, because the source code and associated publication will be available soon.

Right as NetSci ends, I will go back to North America to attend the 2015 edition of the [Complex Systems Summer School](http://www.santafe.edu/education/schools/complex-systems-summer-schools/), held at the [Santa Fe Institute](http://www.santafe.edu), New Mexico, US.

Exciting times ahead!

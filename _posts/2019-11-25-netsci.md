I'm going to attend [NetSciX 2020](https://netscix2020tokyo.github.io/) in Tokyo, to present joint work with [Mark Newman](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/) and [George Cantwell](https://www.george-cantwell.com/).
We have developed a method to automatically and efficiently infer the structure of a network from noisy pairwise observations --- we will post an accompanying paper at some point in the future.
A proceedings in which I appear as a co-author has also been accepted. It is titled "Connected graphs with a given degree sequence: efficient sampling, correlations, community detection and robustness", and it is joint work with [John Ring](https://www.johnhringiv.com/) and [Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/). Come and see us!
